# ECE421: Machine Learning

This repository is for all the projects I did for a machine learning course I did. 
In summary, the content of the projects involve machine learning models and techniques that are used in general predictive analytics and deep learning.
There are 3 projects in total and each cover a particular model(s). 

## Installation

Each of the projects are already in their compartment folders. To test out a project: download the folders exactly as they are in the repository and keep the files the way they are. It is recommended that you use PyCharm or some other IDE for this. 

### Prerequisites

Here are the libraries that you need to run these projects:

Numpy - A data science and scientific computing library. Source: https://numpy.org/install/

Matplotlib - A graph visualization library. Source: https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

TensorFlow - A machine learning library developed by Google. Source: https://www.tensorflow.org/install

## Usage/Running 

It's simple. Just:

```bash
python program_name.py
```
on the PyCharm or OS terminal to run.

Or you can use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to run the code too.

## Projects 

### 1. Linear and Logstic Regression
### 2. CNNs
### 3. SVMs and GMM
